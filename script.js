// I crashed my car today
const excerpt = 
"I crashed my car today. Long story, but essentially my car wouldnt start and I was parked at the top of a hill and had the great idea that I would try a rolling start. So, I let off the handbrake, pulled out and rolled down the hill for about 50 metres turning the ignition key intermittently to no avail. By the 50m mark, I had gained considerable speed (I was going about ~30 km/h). The car still wasnt starting so I decided it was time to pull over and stop. I turned the car left towards the curb and put my foot on the brake... except the brakes wouldnt work. I stomped on the brakes again... and again... still nothing. Presently, I was heading straight for the back of this parked silver car. I panicked, and not wanting to hit the car in front of me, or continue rolling down the hill onto oncoming traffic, I saw a tree to my left and in a split second decided that I would run into the tree to stop instead. Next thing I knew I hit the tree. I sat there a moment unsure of what exactly just happened, feeling very shocked. A girl who lived in the house near the tree came out shortly after and checked to see what had happened. I gave her the thumbs up and she went back inside. Later, I ended up going to hospital because my neck was hurting so much and I was worried that I may have damaged something. In the end I was cleared of any major damage and had just experienced whiplash. Nothing serious. I had walked to the hospital to go to the emergency department and also walked back and on the way back I was again at the scene of the crash. I stood there looking at it sort of chuckling to myself as to how ridiculous it was that the car was so beaten up and on the footpath and how stupid I was to have attempted something as ridiculous as a rolling start when I had never done one before. Another part of me was distraught at the fact at how much money it would cost me to repair, or possibly money lost because it might have to be written off. Either way, walking past the crashed car was really strange because I didnt recall exactly what had happened. The memory was still so fresh and I was still in a state of shock. Looking at the mangled car was very surreal, to see it on the footpath and it appeared to me more of an object than triggering any feeling or memory such as flashing back to the moment of impact. The same night I watched the two films selected for this months roster, “Ashes”, and “La Jetee”. I sort of remembered that “Ashes” was a kind of experimental montage of images without any concrete narrative and that it had a softness to the aesthetic and the story. I couldnt actually remember what it was about. The memory was fuzzy, fragmented, barely there and half-grasped. La Jetee was sort of the same. I knew that the premise was that a man has a memory from his childhood and that memory is of a man being shot on the deck of an airport, and that that man was in fact himself. I knew that its method of storytelling was a series of still photographs as the next film I am making uses this exact method. “Ashes” and “La Jetee” both ask the question: what is memory? This is a difficult one to answer. I remember things and can feel nostalgic about things and look back on things and remember peoples names and know how certain smells conjure up certain memories and things like that. But memory seems so elusive, so varied, and out of reach. It is so hard to pinpoint exactly what it is. I thought back to what happened today. Even though I have flashing images of me in the car rolling down the hill and trying to brake, and then hitting the tree, and then sitting in the car after the crash, I really have no other impression of what happened to me other than the pain in my neck from the whiplash. Even though that crash happened this morning it seems so distant as to how I am feeling right now writing this. And it made me think about how we remember films, or novels, or music, and how we maybe hum a tune, or remember a certain line in a chapter, a line of poetry, or a scene in a film, and we are taken back to a feeling. A feeling? Is that what it is? We feel things in the present but when we remember something, when it flashes in our mind, we succumb to the feeling of that moment again. “Ashes” was about memory. I took some notes while I watched it as a way to remember because I always seem to forget things in films whenever I watch them. I know some people who know whole scenes, whole pieces of dialogue so clearly, but with me it is never clear, more a faint impression or general feeling when I think about a film. And it makes me think of how everyones memory might be different. Sure we remember things like a telephone number, or someones name which shows that we remember somewhat equally, but what about the memory of an experience? Something that has duration? Something like a day at the beach, or going to see a live band, or watching a film. And watching “Ashes” I had to take notes to keep up with it, to remember it. I didnt trust my memory alone to remember what it was about, to remember the images, the themes, the words. And memory in this sense seems so distrustful. I think it was Apichatpong Weerasethakul (the director of Ashes) that was talking at the end of the film commenting on the images that had come before. The black and white images were of his hometown Khon Kaen and the colour images were of a dream that he had except that his dream was something about his hometown (??) See even now I find it hard to remember the exact words, the exact meaning, and this in itself makes me think of the metaphysics of watching a film. What are we actually doing? Are we watching it to experience what the people on screen are experiencing? Are we experiencing it like we experience a painting where we appreciate the aesthetics and the craft and perhaps its story and what it is trying to convey? Am I analysing these things in the moment? Or are we doing what Im doing now and writing about my experience and analysing it after the fact? I am doing all those things, it seems, all at once, and much more too, subconsciously I suppose. “Hometown = black and white, dreams = colour” is one of the notes I wrote. What does that mean? Well, at the time I thought that Apichatpong (Joe) was explaining how when his dream faded from colour into black and white he returned to his hometown. But was he even talking about his hometown? Or a dream of his hometown? Again my memory is blurred, and perhaps that was the films intention. “Dreamlike” is how you describe these kinds of films. More a soft impression than a clean stab. “The present must be stripped away.” This is a quote I wrote down while watching La Jetee. The man in the film, the protagonist who undergoes experiments to travel through time, must have his present stripped away in order to journey into the past or future. Because he has such a strong fixation on an image of his past (his own death and an image of a woman on the deck (his one bit of hope)) they choose him as their subject. After some initial success where memories of a peacetime morning, a peacetime bedroom, children, cats, and graves well up, they see promise in him and continue with the experiments. This time he goes back in time and sees the woman in his memory and instantly recognises her. And the narrator says something extremely poignant about their coming together, interacting, just being with one another: they had no recollection of the past, only the “taste of the moment.” So what is memory or remembering but reliving that “taste of the moment”? Its weird because even though you remember something you forget so many details and minutiae that is just lost, most likely forever, and perhaps only triggered and remembered because of something that happens in the present. So is the present there to serve the triggering of memories? Or is the present there merely to create more memories? Or conversely, is memory there only to give context to the present moment? A history from which you discover which myth you are in. And what about the future and thinking ahead (visualising things), is this the same thing?? It is kind of like memory too. It is blurry, faded, unclear, yet you inhabit feeling. When you think of a lover you dream of what you would do together. You think of a beautiful domestic thing like watching your lover read in the morning light, or laughing together by a river, or kissing in the shade of a large tree. You inhabit these “dreams” and feel them. You are again sort of experiencing them, except that you are never really in direct contact with it like you are in the present. Memory and dreams are like feeling the warmth of a fire at a distance rather than, say, immolating in the fire. Immolation is the present moment, and it is so hot and supercharged with feeling that you hardly have time to process any of it because you are so engulfed in it. So what of this car crash? Well I am left hurt, down some money, and a job to do tomorrow morning re: towing the car. Here I am thinking about the future and making plans for tomorrow. Ive just had a coffee so I may be up for a little bit longer but this has been a helpful exercise to at least get some thoughts down on the page. This was definitely more reflective than my previous criticisms which read more like essays, but I wanted to explore a more creative, reflective approach after some advice from Felix McNamara. He said something extremely profound which I thought of again as I walked home. He said that “what might be most at stake isn’t necessarily the film itself but something beyond it”, which was with regards to how I should approach my film criticism. I have tried to consider “Ashes” and “La Jetee” as launchpads, touchstones, “triggers” as Felix said, for things that are beyond the film itself. And perhaps reading this reflection triggers some things within you too, good things I hope, things to consider, and things to rid of, just like we do every day when we remember and forget.";

// Johnny knows too much
const excerpt2 = 
"Johnny seems to fuck a lot (in Naked (1993). Sex seems to come to him as naturally as anything. He is all for ‘the moment’, never the future, and hardly the past. He muses a lot, and his musings were relevant, microcosmic, aphoristic, elucidating, philosophical, all with Mancunian wit. His outlook on life is that everything is fucked, that the whole world is fucked, and that we are all doomed, so we all may as well just fuck. Right? Who can disagree with sex? It was really a dire movie now that I think about it. It didn’t instil in me any hope or a feeling of betterment having watched it. More of the same, really. More of the same day to day suffering, and with every day inching ever closer to death. What did Johnny say about books? Some things no matter how much you read, we will never understand. I like Johnny, and as bleak as his outlook on life is, he seems to enjoy himself and make the most of his time being alive. I think at one point he says that humans will eventually die out just like the dinosaurs and that all will be forgotten and man will cease to exist - his every mode of being, his every utterance seems to be in the knowledge of this fact and that the end is inevitable. So then, what do you do with your life with this in mind? Well you have jolly good fun all the time like Johnny does. Go from couch to couch, eating other people’s food, pinching other people’s cigarettes, never sleep, always someone new to talk with, always a place to read, always a place to go, a place to sleep, a place to shower. Always someone to fuck. It’s easy to go down this path, and Johnny seems all too happy to continue along. He has come to the conclusion that if he suffers then other people should suffer too, that they should suffer for him not with him. Other people are merely in service of his desires, his needs, his wants. He doesn’t build relationships, he doesn’t seem to care about anyone or anything. He has no home, has no family, no pets, not even a proper friend. He has no future, and doesn’t want one. He doesn’t know where he’s going and doesn’t care. Life is a game to him. Everything is there for play, to be toyed with, laughed over, take the piss out of. So is that what Naked is saying? Life is a game? Just another cliche as Johnny would say. I think everything about this film paradoxically, leads to another cliche, the very thing Johnny despises. So that’s it then? There’s no point in discussing anything? There’s no point in me even writing this reflection. Where does it lead anyway? Why not become a nurse or an aid worker or someone who cares for the sick? That seems to be a nobler cause. They always seem to need aid workers. So why don’t more people do it? Why doesn’t everybody just help each other out? Why is there evil in the world? Because God is wicked Johnny says, and he thinks humans are just for His entertainment. Maybe we are who knows. But we’ll keep ambling along, just like Johnny does at the very end of the film; hobbling, limping, beaten and bruised having had the shit kicked out of us. We are barely alive and just holding it together, as we walk down the road, inching ever closer to our inevitable death. Short postscript. I was thinking about something Johnny said about how in the future humans will be rendered useless, our bodies that is, and consciousness will be encapsulated in some immaterial form. With the introduction of AI and the curve of technological innovation, I don’t see how this can’t be an inevitability. Perhaps humans will become cyborg in ways that we do not yet understand. I don’t think humans will become extinct because of technology, but I can envision a slow degradation of humanist qualities like emotions and feelings, things which get in the way of logic and reason, and the slow rise of assimilation with the bent of technology. Perhaps everything in the future will be AI assisted in some way and things which were once ‘handmade’ will become relics of an ancient past. We are creating more than ever and I wonder how much of it will last, how much of it will be preserved, and how any of it can stand the test of time. History tells us that much will be lost, forgotten, burned and returned to dust. But what of our digital world? Can that be buried beneath the Earth? It is cast in stone is it not? I suppose all of history is available, in some shape or form, on the internet, and physical artworks are preserved by our institutions, museums and galleries. But who curates the digital landscape? Who says “this is an important digital work and it must be preserved”? Does the digital world really have any value whatsoever? Is it merely a lesser version of our corporeal world, our world of smell and taste? Will it ever surpass our corporeal world as the dominant ‘reality’? Or will it become a second reality with which we increasingly interact with as we bounce between ‘real’ life and ‘virtual’ life. And if the internet is like a collective memory (or a collective dream), what about something like the personality of a human? Could that ever be encoded and preserved? Or are their some things that will be forgotten, lost forever, like tears in rain?";

// Blade Runner the Bittersweet
const excerpt3 = 
"There is no greater merging of music, voice and image than when that line is spoken in Blade Runner. It is a ‘one-liner’, and a one-liner is romantic. It has always been associated with romance in films, or is at least a highly romanticised cliche of cinema. Blade Runner is romantic. The score, the one-liners, the intimate, downbeat noir aesthetic. We desire to partake in it’s romance because it is something we long for, like we long for a lover. As the viewer you are suddenly triangulated between the film and Eros, and Eros is lack. In her essay “Eros the Bittersweet”, Anne Carson explains that this perception of lack derives from the metaphorical hole that is within us, and is a hole we crave to be filled. When we watch Blade Runner, we are struck by a world which suddenly fills that hole. A feeling overcomes us and makes our heart soar. What is this feeling? You could say it is something like the feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia for another time. Which time? A fictional time. One that exists only onscreen. Yet you desire to return to it. You attempt to reach across the void and grasp it, to be part of its romance. Yet you never quite get a hold of it. Just as desire sets in, the movie ends, and there immediately begins your longing for it once more. Why? Cinema of today is so clean and crisp. Although these larger-than-life worlds are rich in detail, you fail to connect with them. They are spectacular, but that is all they remain: a spectacle. You are never truly in contact with the world because it remains untouchable, always at arms length, out of reach. Yet in Blade Runner, Los Angeles is rainy, it's dirty, it's gritty. You can almost smell it. It has character, personality, and charm, as opposed to being sterile, cold, or soulless. These words are so often associated with neighbourhoods of culture that have undergone gentrification, which brings me to my next point. Blade Runner has been gentrified. How? Here is now apt to place the old Blade Runner in its context, alongside its newer sequel, Blade Runner 2049. 2049 is the gentrified version of the original. It only signals at what made the original so magical, so beautiful and so romantic. It is a cultivated, cleaner, and more commercialised version. Much of this aesthetic correlates with the artistic direction afforded by the film’s budget, and 2049 was a big-budget film. It is beautifully shot, and Roger Deakin’s cinematography is a work of art in many respects. And I’m not saying this gentrified version is necessarily a bad thing. Occasional upheaval can bring renewed spirit. However, something is almost certainly lost in the process. And between the original and 2049, there is something that 2049 does not do which the original does: ensnare you in the irresistible web of Eros. 2049 is something to behold. The original is something you could hold. Why does that matter? Well it comes back to the point about encountering Eros and reaching across the void to grasp the desired or beloved. There is something about the original in how it presented itself that makes it immensely more tangible compared to 2049. The original appears almost like a papier-mâché model. It is rough around the edges, but you see beauty in its crags and crevices. But most importantly you see the human hand by which it was made. On the other hand, 2049 is carved with a laser. It is clinical, clean, crisp, chiseled out with robotic precision. It is aesthetically more refined. More a Greek statue to behold as opposed to a papier-mâché model you can touch and feel. The original is the human. 2049 is the replicant. To return to where we started, with Roy Batty’s famous last words, we come to the subtle and delicate tones of the music that accompany Roy's final utterance. Vangelis’ score is so empathetic to the human condition that it carries you along when it swells to the highest highs of the cosmos, down to the Earth and to earthly things, like falling in love. 2049’s score is the exact opposite. Raucous, distressing, harsh, angular. It is of a replicants hand, and not one who is empathetic towards humanity. Blade Runner is a masterpiece. It strikes us at our core desire for desire. We partake in it’s romance because it fills the metaphorical hole within us, a hole which we didn’t realise was there until we watch the film and are struck by Eros. We can never live in that world. But at the very least, we can watch Deckard and Rachel encounter each other, and perhaps through them we are able to enjoy the experience of being triangulated between ourselves, Eros, and the world of Blade Runner.";

// Tarantino's ballad to his beloved medium
const excerpt4 = 
"Quentin Tarantino’s 9th film, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, is a jam-packed epic. Set towards the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood in 1969, this was a film for film-lovers with each scene a tightly choreographed sequence that conveyed not only Tarantino’s vast knowledge of film but his eye for great cinema and his love of movies. Everything from the hokey, fictional TV shows Bounty Law and FBI (shot in the old Academy ratio) to the hand-painted movie posters, the film was oozing with nostalgia for Old Hollywood. In doing so, the film certainly tugged at the heartstrings, especially when a corny one-liner was said. Like when Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio) in The 14 Fists of McCluskey says “Did anybody order fried sauerkraut!?” after torching a group of Nazis with his flamethrower, or when Tex Watson (Austin Butler) says “I’m as real as a doughnut motherfucker.” The movie was full of these wonderful one-liners which, it has to be said, is business as usual for Tarantino. The structure of the film could be seen as a series of 'vignettes', each with their own distinct character, mis-en-scene, and function, yet strung together in seamless fashion. For example, the film opens with a sequence of scenes with Rick Dalton in action, killing outlaws in Bounty Law. Rick and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are then interviewed by a TV host who has a bright, mid-Atlantic, radio voice, so often associated with that era. This interview was shot in black and white and in the old Academy format. Cut to a few scenes later, Rick has just been told by Marvin Shwarz (Al Pacino) his career is heading down the drain if he continues playing the role of the ‘heavy’ (the bad guy). He’s out in the carpark and is telling Cliff he must go to Rome to act in these “goddamn I-talian movies” and that he’s a “has-been”. He sucks on his cigarette desperately and begins to cry, with Cliff consoling him with a brotherly pat and words of support. These scenes were shot in colour and a widescreen format. Through these opening scenes, you see the duality of the ‘actor’ and the ‘human’. You begin to take notice of the actual actor’s performance, as in the aforementioned scenes, the acting of Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt. This is an observation that is always in the background when viewing a film, at times noticeable and at others transparent, yet Tarantino sets a premise - he wants you to take notice of the actor’s work. Another one of these ‘vignettes’ showcasing the actor's craft, was the scene in the saloon with Rick Dalton and James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant). First of all, the scene was so rich in it’s cinematography; the bar lit in this cool, direct sunlight, the swirling smoke from Rick’s exhale of a cigarette, the collection of crumbs and left-over nuts strewn across the bar. Everything about it was pure cinema. After they take a shot of Mescal, they sit on a table by the bar and begin discussing something about the Lancer family. The camera then pans around James’ head to face Rick, who then fluffs his lines. He asks to do a retake and they continue. Rick, a few lines later, forgets his lines again, apologises to the director, yells at himself, then psyches himself up saying “You’re Rick fucking Dalton.” Following this scene, Rick bursts into his trailer, throws whatever objects he can get his hands on at the wall, and yells at himself for looking like he didn’t rehearse, when in fact he rehearsed a lot. He then looks into a mirror on the wall, and looking straight down the camera he says “If you forget your lines again, I’m gonna blow your motherfucking brains out”, as if he is speaking directly to the audience. You feel the pressure he is under, you feel the pressure of the actor, and you come to appreciate the craft of the actor. Tarantino showcases the actor as more than just the character onscreen, but as a human-being. This was no more evident than in the aftermath of the kidnapping scene with Rick, Trudi Frazer (Julia Butters) and Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry) where Trudi walks up to Rick and whispers in his ear 'that was the best acting that I have ever seen in my life', to which Rick says thank you, and later says to himself 'You're Rick fucking Dalton.' Tarantino’s hand is all over this film, from the editing to the cinematography, and of course the script and dialogue. One scene that I had never seen before, and would struggle to find a comparison to, was when Cliff leaves Rick’s house, walks to his car, backs out, does a 180, and drives off. This sequence was all shot from the roof of Rick’s house and was from a perspective I had never seen before. It was a really cool shot, and something for the film-lover to indulge in. This metacognitive idea of ‘feeling’ the director behind the scenes was also evident in Rick’s first meeting with James Stacy. James is seen talking to Rick, then all of a sudden, it cuts to another segment of their conversation, then cuts again with James' hat dropping onto his head. Here you feel the hand of the director and the editor. Tarantino’s love of film and the movie-goers experience was also illustrated, namely by a handful of scenes. Marvin Shwarz “lights up and pours himself a cognac”, sits down and watches The 14 Fists of McCluskey on 5mm. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) visits the Bruin movie theatre, to watch the film The Wrecking Crew (projected on film) where she stars as Freya Carlson, the ‘klutz’. Later, Rick and Cliff are kicking back at Rick's place with a few beers and some takeaway pizza while they watch the TV show FBI, where Rick makes a guest appearance. It’s the excitement of the movie-going experience that Tarantino captures so beautifully with these scenes. And then, there is the scene of Sharon Tate walking out of the theatre. Around the time of the infamous ‘golden hour’, the sky is a pale grey-blue, and Sharon adorns a smile with the melancholic glee of having just watched a movie. Beyond these observations, the main story of the film was continually stirring in the background and served to anchor each vignette. The film being set in early-February and then later, in early-August of 1969, it follows the events leading up to the brutal murder of Sharon Tate and four others at Roman Polanski’s Hollywood home (Rick is their neighbour in the film). However, instead of these murders taking place in the movie, the members of the Manson cult break into Rick's home and attempt to murder Cliff, Rick and Rick’s wife Francesca (Lorenza Izzo). The ensuing fight between Cliff, Cliff’s dog Brandy, and the Manson family members was brutal. Brandy chomps the intruders to bits while Cliff grabs the ginger character’s head smashes it first into a telephone, then a stone ledge above the fireplace, and finally a desk. This was perhaps the most visceral fight scene I’ve ever seen - you can't help but wince in pain. And to top it all off, the final black-haired member is torched to death by Rick Dalton and his flamethrower from The 14 Fists of McCluskey. This entire sequence harks back to fight scenes in Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and in particular, to the scene in Inglorious Basters when Hitler’s face is pulverised by a sub-machine gun. The film ends with Rick Dalton meeting Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) after talking to the police, and is invited up to the house by Sharon Tate. The title “Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood” is displayed and the credits role. As with any Hollywood film, there is always a happy ending, and for Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood, there is no exception. The brutal truth of the murder of Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring is forgotten and everyone leaves the cinema happy. In summary, this Hollywood epic is dense with all of the stuff film-lovers would love. From the corny one-liners to the beautifully choreographed vignettes of the actors ‘acting’, to the move posters, to the fight scenes – this film really has it all. This is Tarantino’s most intellectual film, a very self-aware and metacognitive look at all facets of film: acting, directing, editing, cinematography etc. Possibly an outcast in his filmography, Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood will be remembered for showcasing Tarantino’s love for film and film-goers, and could be seen as a ballad to his beloved medium.";

// my first hit of heroin
const excerpt5 = 
"I think Heaven Knows What, right now, is my favourite movie of all time. Why? It was depraved. Heaven Knows What was a portrait of the depraved. The lost and forgotten world that we see in our cities. Drug addicts, junkies, the homeless - crackheads as we call them in Australia. A derogatory word really and one that effaces the humanness of these people and treats them as second-rate. The film is based on the memoir of the lead actress Arielle Homes who was encouraged to write the memoir after meeting one of the directors, Josh Safdie. In many respects this film is a documentary of her life. However fictional the premise of the film might be, it showed no signs that this was fiction. This was real, this was happening. There on screen is Arielle Homes actually shooting up. That wasn’t acting. That was real. I’ve been putting off writing this critique because what was there to critique? My mind kept returning to the characters in the film and I reminded myself when things weren’t going as well as they could have, that life isn’t as tough as Harley and Iliya and Michael’s is. It was like they were a new baseline, a new low that I experienced and one that I can't seem to forget. It was as though I entered their world and lived in that world with them for a time and came out the other end a new person. It isn’t farfetched to say that I was changed by my experience of watching Heaven Knows What. It seriously shifted my perspective on life, particularly those who look less fortunate who look like they are under the influence of drugs or look like they are struggling. The story was relatable maybe because the characters were in New York, a city, and I live in the city and I see these characters who are just like Harley and Iliya and Michael on the streets. Maybe for this reason it resonated so strongly with me. A film about poverty in a developing country might have had a similar impact, in terms of forming this new baseline from which you can feel grateful for all of the things you have in your privileged, Western life, yet it would hit different. It would be a different feeling entirely. I don’t know but Heaven Knows What affected me like not many films have, and it has opened my eyes to the humanity that can be found in even the most depraved situations. “People are valuable” as Nick Cave points out, and one can easily forget that these druggos, these junkies, these crackheads, are humans like the rest of us. We forget this most of the time. OK I’ve come back to finish this goddamn review or critique or whatever it is (it’s been 3 weeks since the above was written). (Quick aside: Is this really helping anyone? Probably not, but if you are reading this I hope you’ve at least enjoyed my rambling on about all these films. Making films and writing these critiques keeps me going. Something to do I guess.) There’s one thing that I wanted to say about Heaven Knows What that has been on my mind these past few weeks. The films that I watched since (or attempted to watch (I stopped watching a few for reasons I will now explain)) pale in comparison to the stark realism and visceral intensity of Heavem Knows What to the point where every film that I have seen since has seemed “soft” or too “delicate” or too “cute” for it to really connect with me. It’s almost as if Heaven Knows What was my first hit of heroin and that now, there is no going back. Having had a taste of that feeling, that hit, everything seems totally subpar - I want that heroin again. I want to see the fucked up and depraved lives of people. I want to see the dark corners that many films do not dare to venture to. I want more. I know this in itself sounds fucked up, but these are the stories that we need to know about and are the stories that I connect with and find more interesting than say a gentle love story. I realised that Heaven Knows What is the kind of movie that I like and is the kind of movie that has in the past had the most impact on me. I began thinking about other ‘docufiction’ or reality-in-motion type films I have seen, films such as Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark, or Abbas Kiarostami’s Close-Up or Chris Marker’s Sans Soleil or La Jetee. And even films that were more fiction, their aesthetic or story was realist or neo-realist, films like Once Upon a Time in America, Synecdoche, New York, Blue is the Warmest Colour, or Stalker. Of course there are exceptions, but these are the kind of films that have impacted me most and to be honest are the kind of films I would like to make myself. Going back to Heaven Knows What, I really crave another hit like that and I’m sure there are many films out there that do that. (Please write in if you have any recommendations.) Perhaps there are even books that are like that to? I’m not sure. I’m trying to read more and at the moment Nick Cave and Sean O’Hagan’s book Faith Hope and Carnage has been extremely grounding, guiding, and elucidating. It’s a great read and very accessible and I highly recommend picking it up if you have the cash. That book too is quite documentarian and is about real people and real troubles and real-life so to speak. It speaks to the heart of our experiences as humans. And I think Heaven Knows What does exactly the same. It finds the humanity in even the most depraved, and through this revelation you encounter the true depths of human experience more than most films or works of art I've encountered ever do. It is a vital work of art and one that deserves more attention.";

// I hate that I have to read it
const excerpt6 = 
"I hate that I have to read it. Not because I want to, but because I have to. Nietzsche, Freud, Jung, Dostoyevsky; Proust, Dickens, Joyce, Ulysses; Eliot, Yeats, Shakespeare, Blake; Dante, Machiavelli, Goethe, Faust; Walter Benjamin, Adorno, Barthes, Kant; Homer, Plato, Socrates, Sappho; reading these authors is like a rite of passage. In order to be a serious academic, you must read most if not all of these author’s otherwise remain a dilettante. I’ve always thought that reading these authors meant you were playing with the ‘big boys’ and that every esteemed artist has read all of these authors, or is at least aware of the essence of their work. The only author that I have somewhat of a grasp on is Carl Jung. In this respect, I still feel like an outsider. Presently, I am the dilettante. I read short passages of the works of these authors from time to time, yet never invest in a proper interrogation of their work. Usually, this is because I fail to connect with their work or consider certain concepts too abstract or too difficult to understand and so I drop the book and the author too. This might have to do with a metaphysical weight I feel when I read, or even consider reading works by these authors. They seem heavy and dense and require a lot of time and energy and focus which makes them all the more daunting. One thing I admire about these authors is how they consistently achieve a deepness to their work while also achieving breadth. I would like my criticism to be deeper. Presently, it is not very deep. Even though it may touch on deep subjects, there still remains a shallowness to it. Perhaps this perceived shallowness is best summarised by how little time I spend on each piece of criticism, which only ranges from 1 to 3 days. I have in my mind this idea that the greatest works of the above authors took years to write and that profound and illuminating work can only be achieved purely through spending a lot of time on something. A Chinese parable, which Italo Calvino retells in his short novel Six Memos for the Next Millennium, hints that this belief may be misleading: Among Chuang-tzu's many skills, he was an expert draftsman. The king asked him to draw a crab. Chuang-tzu replied that he needed five years, a country house, and twelve servants. Five years later the drawing was still not begun. 'I need another five years,' said Chuang-tzu. The king granted them. At the end of these ten years, Chuang-tzu took up his brush and, in an instant, with a single stroke, he drew a crab, the most perfect crab ever seen. Time creates a certain posture to a work. If a work took 5 seconds to make, then we will aptly view it as something like a sketch; quick, fast, and instinctual. If a work of art took 5 years then we will aptly view it as something that took a lot of time, thought, energy, precision and patience to make. Time spent on something not only alters the finished product, but alters how that product is viewed. I don’t know where I’m going with this exactly. I was writing all of this as a preface to my critique of the towering achievement, Anatomy of a Fall, which won the Palme d’Or this year (2023). Film is very different to literature. Concepts in literature can be hard to understand as authors have the luxury to be very abstract and poetic, and syntax (and vocabulary) can also prove to be a barrier. Film seems to present things as they are, where there is no one clear definition or meaning or interpretation. Although literature may do that too, it is more certain of its meaning. Film is strange because it occupies a sort of middle-ground between art, literature and music; it is like art because it is a visual medium, it is like literature because it tells us a story, and it is like music because, well, music generally accompanies and imbues the former two with meaning. It is a blend of these different spheres, and certain films seem to lean into one or two of them more than the others. Anatomy of a Fall practically begins with a song. A snippet of a sample from the song P.I.M.P. by 50 cent blares down through the chalet from upstairs while Sandra, a writer, is being interview by a journalist. Her interview is clearly disrupted by the music, which was intentionally put on by Samuel (her husband) and asks the journalist if they would like to visit another time, or meet in Grenoble. This song essentially becomes the film’s theme as it is replayed over and over. The song in its first playing was gentile and playful and had great comic effect, where Sandra sort of laughs at the absurdity of the situation with the journalist. Its next playing is in the courtroom where Sandra is being investigated for the alleged murder of her husband. Here, the song takes on a completely different meaning. It is suddenly filled with irony and satire and becomes very abrasive in how playful it sounds in the serious environment of the courtroom. Here, music takes centre stage and becomes a focal point, a pivot of the film. The song becomes almost like a bad memory, and becomes more and more abrasive as the movie continues. I really need to watch this film again because it is hard for me to really remember much of it. I just remembered that it was an ‘emotional rollercoaster’. Is that the best I can muster? Is that seriously the best I can do when describing this film? Maybe I do need to watch it a second time. I think I will. Watch this space.";

// goodness is only a reflection of evil
const excerpt7 = 
"There is a scene in Possession (1981) where Anna (Isabelle Adjani) is literally channeling the evil spirit from beyond. It is the scene in the U-Bahn tunnel where Anna, having just smashed her bag full of milk into the wall, erupts into a wicked fit. This was the exorcism to end all exorcisms. The birth of the devil himself. Shots of the slime-tentacle-octo-demon in the bedroom (reminiscent of the demon child in “Eraserhead”) of the abandoned Berlin apartment seem to represent something else entirely. While Anna’s delirium in the tunnel was channelling some divine evil, the demon that was in the bedroom represented evil rot. Evil was the name, possession was the game. It was really a simple story with simple dialogue, yet with shocking visuals, such as the scene when Anna raises the electric blade to her neck and cuts herself. It made me think of blood in films and I don’t think I’ve seen a better use of blood than in Possession. Maybe Tarantino’s films come close, but his are much more comical. In Possession, the blood was messy and everywhere, and was such a vibrant colour, it looked real. As a matter of fact, everything was messy. The shots were messy. The dialogue was messy. The acting was messy. But that’s how I like it, and it had the same signature camerawork of Andrzej Zulawski’s unfinished masterpiece 'On the Silver Globe' which I absolutely adore. Thinking about it now there were many forms of evil in the film. Adultery, physical abuse, verbal abuse, manipulation, rape, sexual assault, murder, and even child sexual abuse. Evil was the norm. Good was nonexistent. The film kept mentioning evil, and God, and I think it was saying something of God’s mercilessness. Mark didn’t believe in God, he thought He was a ‘disease’. Was this film allegorical in some way? Almost certainly. You could view Anna as the Virgin Mary who falls pregnant with the Devil’s child, Satan, and births him into the world. There is a sequence where Anna is in a church and looks up at Jesus on the cross and begins moaning. I’m not sure what this means, but I think this was the Devil within that was moaning in the face of God’s son, or even the evil twin brother of Jesus, a Satan, calling out from the womb of Anna the Virgin. Going back to that scene in the U-bahn tunnel, Anna’s wild movements and releases of energy was cathartic. It was as though what she was doing was not for her, but for all of us, possessing all evil and letting it course through her body. So evil is everywhere? Is it all around us? Is that we just can’t see it? Or perhaps we are those who choose not to be tempted by it. This path that we’re on, this idea of always spreading the love, the “you got this” generation - is it papering over the cracks? Are we covering up the evils of the world by spreading love for loves sake? Perhaps we should be more realistic here. There is suffering, dare I say more suffering than we can possibly fathom. Everyone is suffering, and there are evil, wicked things out there that are committed, by humans, every day. The news picks up on it, but the news is deflating, so we roll over and put on a TV show or a movie or read a book. We distract ourselves from the evil that surrounds us all, that is right there in front of us. Possession says that there is no Heaven without Hell, there is no good without evil, and there is no light without dark. We must remain on an even keel and Possession pulls the tide towards evil, towards the yin, towards darkness and Hell to remind us that we should be in touch with our Shadow, that we are all capable of evil, that we are all capable of being monsters, that our souls, as Carl Jung pointed out, as much as they reach up to Heaven also reach down to the depths of Hell. There was this repeated moaning from Anna like she was always being fucked or something. Being fucked by the Devil himself. And then, when she is at the ballet school, she channels the Devil and he fucks the little girl who poses. That was the moment of pure evil. Child abuse. But Zulawski doesn’t shy away from this fact. Child abuse is an evil that exists. Rarely do we see art or film discuss subject matters so evil, so dark. Perhaps this was Zulawski’s way of shining a ‘light’ into the darknesses of our world. So in attempting to find another film that Possession reminded me of, I came across the Frtizl case in Austria. I’m sure you would’ve heard about it in some way. Josef Fritzl was the man who locked his daughter Elisabeth in a basement for 24 years. He raped, sexually abused and assaulted Elisabeth and she gave birth to seven of his children, one of which died shortly after birth. Josef Fritzl was arrested in 2008 and was later sentenced to life imprisonment. I mean, that right there just shows you that evil is around. Just when you think everything is all fine and rosy, you come across something like this. Pure, premeditated, carefully orchestrated, evil. Humans are capable of this, and Possession, for all it’s surreal and disturbing imagery, cuts to the core of the very thing thing that humans choose to forget. Evil. We have a choice to make. We have a choice to not fall into temptation, and instead aim for the highest possible good that we can be. That is a choice. But you must always remember and never forget that you are the very same thing that created the Gulag, who orchestrated the Holocaust, and who locked his daughter in a basement for 24 years. You are human and you are capable of evil. Never forget it. Post script. It’s hard to talk about evil. We honestly forget that evil even exists in the world. I’m not saying like it needs more airtime or something, because pretty much every time I open up the BBC app on my phone there is some form of evil that has been done in the world. It’s just difficult to talk about because I have a propensity towards doing good, like most people, who look for the good in their lives and in others and strive to aim for the highest good. Be good. Do the right thing. Treat others how you would like to be treated. Old sayings and cliches but they have lasted this long for a reason. There is something in them that speaks to the very essence of our being. It speaks to the choice we make every day to do good, to act good, to do good things for yourself and others, and to leave the world a better place than it was before. Richer, more vibrant, brighter. I’ve been reading Nick Cave and Sean O’Hagan’s book “Faith, Hope and Carnage”, and here is a quote from Cave that I thought was quite fitting. Sean O’Hagan: So do you believe in the redemption in the Christian sense? Nick Cave: Well, I think we’re all suffering Sean, and more often than not this suffering is a hell of our own making, it is a state of being for which we are responsible, and I have personally needed to find some kind of deliverance from that. One way I do that is to try to lead a life that has moral and religious value, and to try to look at other people, all people, as if they are valuable. I feel that when I have done something to hurt an individual, say, that the wrong-doing also affects the world at large, or even the cosmic order. I believe that what I have done is an offence to God and should be put right in some way. I also believe our positive individual actions, our small acts of kindness, reverberate through the world in ways we will never know. I guess what I am say is - we mean something. Our actions mean something. We are of value. This is a quote coming from a man who’s son died after falling off a cliff. He was 20. I think if anyone is in touch with the wickedness, the cruelty, the sheer mercilessness of God and the forces of evil and the place of Hell, Cave would be that person. And Cave, here, ultimately chooses to do good. For him there is no other choice. A world of bitterness, hatred, cynicism, and resentment is not rectitude for him. His relationship to God matters. He views God as the ultimate judge, and he strives to aim high and live a good life. He has come from a dark place and must find the light. His album “Ghosteen” is in many ways his absolution, and in his own words, his way of making sense of all the pain and suffering.";

// barbie vs andrew tate
const excerpt8 = 
"Barbie. A household name known around the world has come to represent what young women could aspire to be. While the doll Barbie couldn't speak, film Barbie could, and it had a lot to say (and poke fun at) regarding female empowerment, feminism and womanhood. Yet that is not what I would like to focus on here. I saw a parallel message to the one targeted at young women which has to do with Ken's journey, and his struggle for identity. Barbie shows us how easily young men fall into performing “man”. Judith Butler notes “gender is a kind of doing” and there is a current version of masculinity that young men are doing that has become colloquially known as “toxic masculinity”. This 'toxic' version of masculinity isn't new and is well-documented in films and TV shows (think Rocky Balboa, Cool Hand Luke, Mad Men). Elisabeth Krimer notes that all of the essays in 'Subverting Masculinity' (published in 2000) show that 'masculinity emerges as a concept under siege', and in 2023, this siege is well underway. The societal pressures for men to perform 'man' has slowly disintegrated and new norms are becoming more mainstream.Butler and Krimer both agree that society provides 'norms', and these norms provide coercive criteria which govern ideals of what constitutes a 'real' man or a 'real' woman. (Butler, 1990; Krimer, 2000). So who are the people that decide what this norm looks and sounds like? Russell West in 'Subverting Masculinity' notes that 'film's combination of visual, textual, and performance discourses' make it 'such a potent encoding of gender patterns.'' Today 'film' could largely been seen as films on social media. And who is the face of masculine, male performance on social media? Andrew Tate. And Barbie says there is a danger in that. Andrew Tate is in every sense (rhetoric, internet-phenomena, pop-culture) Barbie's antithesis. He is global personality who was once the most Googled man on Earth and has built a large following, specifically from young men, and his reach should not be underestimated. Tate’s message is manifold, but critically argues for “masculine excellence” and the reprising of “traditional masculinity”. Tate offers men guidance to become a certain image of 'man': “strong, charismatic, wealthy”. He tells men not to submit to the “enslavement” of feminists who are trying to “cut your balls off” and instil “cowardice”, and his extreme performance of masculinity (loud, arrogant, aggressive) and how he “doesn’t easily bend a knee” (Peterson, 2023), is in itself his message. Ken's journey from Barbieland, to the real world, into Kendom foreshadows how easily young men are corrupted by trend-setters like Andrew Tate which offer them reclamation of their manhood. When Ken (and the other Kens) begin behaving like Andrew Tate, they become monsters. They impose their power over the Barbies, treat them as servants, as second-rate, and as sex objects. They behave in a way that suggests they have contempt for the Barbies and by extension women. What is most worrying is that these Andrew Tateisms are no longer just on the periphery, but have slowly moved more and more into the mainstream. Barbie is a film of the moment, and it is saying that in this moment young men are looking up to the wrong man. Who or what is the alternative? Ken. Ken's journey out of Kendom and back to Barbieland shows us that it is possible to break free from the societal pressures and to reevaluate traditional norms of masculinity. Ken realises he was being disingenuous to himself when he was trying to act “cool” and be the “tough guy”. Instead, he saw that he should be the “warm” man (to borrow a phrase from the School of Life): sensitive, vulnerable, and caring. The dance sequence towards the end of the film displays this struggle to decide between being the “cool” disingenuous man or the “warm” genuine man. Ken opts for the latter, and realises he doesn't have to be like anyone. He can just be Ken. This internal struggle between being part of 'the boys' or just being 'you' is something that many adolescent boys face growing up (think of Jonah Hill's film 'Mid90s'). Barbie was a cultural 'event' and I can imagine many girlfriends dragging their boyfriends along, or sisters going to see it with their brothers, fathers and their daughters. Barbie took the chance to say something loud and clear to this younger generation: the mysogyny, sexual abuse, harrassment, domestic violence, and contempt for women, all associated with this brand of toxic masculinity, must end. Ken shows men there is an alternative. Barbie killed Andrew Tateisms dead in the water. But would everyone see it this way? There is a very easy temptation to walk out of the film and think that the message was: “all men are evil”. At one point, I succumbed to the films negative portrayal of men and even felt a little disarmed. Writing now, I find it hard to discuss some issues in the film because I am a man, and because I’m a man, I am not in the position to talk about certain issues, specifically ones that relate to women. In saying this, I would like to stress the fact that we don’t live in a vacuum. It is an open dialogue: a woman issue is a man issue and vice versa. The dissolution of any contructive dialogue only widens inequality, not close it up. The conclusion that Barbie was merely preaching “women are good, men are evil” would be a great TikTok edit. If you dig a little deeper past this first superficial layer, you discover that Barbie, who represents women, in the end lives in a harmonious and respectful society in relation to Ken, who represents men, and both men and women benefit as a result. Perhaps a film like Barbie was the only way a message like this could be delivered. What about a ground-breaking novel? Sure, but it wouldn’t have had the same engagement, particularly with a younger audience, and nowhere near to the same scale. Again, placing the film in context of social media (#Barbenheimer) Barbie is seismic. A middle-of-the-road film that talked about the same issues, a film like “Little Women” (which Gerwig also directed), wouldn’t have had the same impact. It wouldn’t have been such a cultural “event”. But most importantly, it wouldn’t have drawn in the sheer number and diversity of crowds into the cinema. My fear is that young men will take this film the wrong way and blanket hate against it and am afraid that this is likely an inevitability. Yet I hope there are some that will dig just a little deeper, because for all of its gloss and glamour, there is something deeper to Barbieland. Barbie was a film of the moment and I wonder whether we will see any real change after its message has sunk in... or whether it will be just another social media post that we double-tap, scroll past, and forget.";

// fervour italia
const excerpt9 = 
"I would like to begin this critique with two quotations from Italo Calvino’s Six Memos for the Next Millenium from his chapter on ‘multiplicity’: “Carlo Emilio Gadda tried all his life to represent the world as a knot, a tangled skein of yarn; to represent it without in the least diminishing the inextricable complexity or, to put it better, the simultaneous presence of the most disparate elements that converge to determine every event.” “…as in each episode in one of Gadda’s novels, the least thing is seen as the center of a network of relationships that the writer cannot restrain himself from following, multiplying the details so that his descriptions and digressions become infinite. Whatever the starting point, the matter in hand spreads out and out, encompassing ever vaster horizons, and if it were permitted to go on further and further in every direction, it would end by embracing the entire universe.” I wished to begin this critique with these quotations, at first for it to act as a starting point before embarking on any deeper study, and because these quotations were what I read before I entered the cinema to see Federico Fellini’s 8 1/2 and are in my orbit as I write this critique. I reflected later that there was a distinct connection between Calvino’s elucidations and Federico Fellini’s films, most garishly because they are both Italian and convey a similar fervour that comes off both the page and the screen, and more critically due to a shared commonality on their vision of things, in particular life itself. Furthermore, I found distinct parallels between La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ and in recalling the images, their narratives would bleed into one another as though they were somehow inseparable. It is for this reason that I am going to draw my analysis from both films as though they were one. After leaving the cinema, having watched 8 1/2 and having watched La Dolce Vita earlier that week­, it struck me that both films were in one sense about experiencing the ‘mystery of life’ and that Marcello Mastroianni’s characters in both were attempting to unravel it. Mastroianni's characters were not really above or below in society, but were good-looking middle-class men who were in direct contact with chaotic events taking place in everyday life. Marcello (La Dolce Vita) and Guido (8 1/2­) acted like a mirror for the audience, asking us to peer into our own inner being and invoking a necessity for critical reflection. Marcello for example, was taken all over Rome; from a prostitute’s home, to nightclubs, to a castle, he became this sentinel for the audience on a mission to uncover something. But what? This question is never truly answered. His role as a journalist is not without significance as his sensibility was always tweaked with inquisitiveness as his duty was to investigate and report his findings (to the audience). In the film we see him surmount perhaps his greatest challenge: reporting on the spectacle of his own life. Curiously, La Dolce Vita could in fact spread out and out, expanding in either direction, for example, including Marcello’s early childhood or his old age. This is maybe where 8 1/2­ ties in, where Guido’s early memories as a boy (taunting the gypsy Saraghina to dance, his punitive experiences at church) and his experiences of his later life (such as the dream sequences depicting the distant relationship with his father and the harem of the women he met during his life), are continuations in each direction, or even better, fragments that are a part of the ‘collective narrative’ of La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­. If Fellini’s narrative was “permitted to go on further and further” I have no doubt that it would indeed end up “embracing the entire universe.” Both films could be described as a “tangled skein of yarn”, or more precisely, a tangled skein of ‘tête-à-têtes’; some appearing to be of solemn importance while others mere sweet nothings, idle musings, or flirtatious banter. Here, there are clear parallels to Calvino’s observations on Gadda’s work, in that Fellini was able to make even the least significant conversation appear to be at the centre of a “network of relationships” where Mastroianni’s characters were again like a mirror or a sentinel, but in a very human way as they attempted to navigate a myriad of personal relationships. Notable examples include: his troubled relationship with the church and religion, his distant relationship with his father (in both films), the apparent judgement from others of his wife Emma (in La Dolce Vita), his wife’s suspicion of his infidelity, his relationship with his own psyche and neurosis, and so on. Each conversation exposed these relationships, and more broadly, were always in service of something greater, this ‘other’ that could be felt as being the mystery of life. In the final scene of La Dolce Vita, Marcello sees a young girl across a small body of water while he was by the ocean, a girl that he in fact had come across on his travels earlier in the film. Out of earshot and failing to communicate through speaking she makes gestures with her hands to say that she knows him. And yet Marcello puts his hands up in confusion and frowns as if to say ‘I don’t understand? What are you trying to say?’ After a few attempts, she gives up and she smiles, with the hope of him remembering her lost, then turns her head and looks directly into the camera and the screen fades to black. With this simple look, she seems to bring the audience physically into the film,? but it is hard to pinpoint what exactly she is trying to do. In one sense she is showing us that she sees us, and she is inviting us in, inviting the world into the film. In many ways the film was like watching life-in-motion, and the girl's look brings the world in creating an eternal connection between the outside world and the film. Marcello’s miscommunication appears now to be something more symbolic, as though he was saying, with a quick offhandness ‘I don't understand...what is this? What is all of this? This thing called life?’ In keeping with this theme, the final sequence in 8 1/2­ where Guido, depicted here as a small boy, leads a marching band at twilight, was Fellini’s way of saying that we are all children, marching to the beat of life’s music, into the night, for all eternity. Most mysterious was both Marcello and Guido’s relationship with women, and the roles they played in their lives. Maddalena, Marcellos’s first romantic encounter in La Dolce Vita, was a lover and could be nothing more. His wife Emma, embodied a more maternal love, seen feeding him, worrying about him, and calling him incessantly – her love for him was unconditional and true. And Slyvia, with such beauty and charm was the epitome of every man’s desires, and for Marcello an untouchable idol of sex and desire, an incarnation of Venus herself. These roles were reprised in 8 1/2­: Carla his boisterous lover, Luisa his stable, maternal wife, and Claudia, the woman of his dreams. Both Marcello and Guido were womanisers, and their treatment of women was at times unfair where infidelity was an accepted norm. However, there remained an undue respect, and at times even a worship towards women. This was no more apparent than when Guido “finally gets his harem” in 8 1/2­. One could view both Marcello and Guido as unlikeable characters, and yet with all their flaws, they were perhaps more emblematic of how a person acts in the face of a burning desire. Both films show that the film medium – so often today associated as a medium for the masses, as ‘entertainment’ – is capable of provoking deep intellectual thought. I found both films reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky’s films, in particular Andrei Rublev and Stalker. One could even go as far as saying that La Dolce Vita was Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev, with its depiction of the joys and horrors of life, and 8 1/2­ Tarkovsky’s Stalker, for its story about dreams and memories and for all its surrealism. These films were from a distinct era, with a tangible quality of free-spiritedness, truly in touch with the human condition. The sheer mass of people in certain frames, who moved in such a raw, unchoreographed way, and the actors who acted with such freedom and better still a palpable exactitude, it was as though it were life itself. I have attempted to thread a line through La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ and perhaps have only just begun an endless journey of analysis. Carlo Emilio Gadda and Italo Calvino for that matter, would have much to say about these films and perhaps I have provided them with their starting point from which they could continue to digress into the infinite. La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ are Fellini’s masterpieces, and will be forever cherished as a part of the history of cinema for, if anything, their sheer scale as towering depictions of life and all its mystery.";

//stalker
const excerpt10 = 
"Stalker (1979) is a film directed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky starring Alexander Kaidanovsky (the Stalker), Anatoly Solonitsyn (the Writer), Nikolai Gink (the Professor), and Alisa Freindlich (the Stalker’s wife). The screenplay was written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and is loosely based on their 1972 novel “Roadside Picnic”. Tarkovsky, Solonitsyn and Tarkovsky’s wife Larisa Tarkovskaya would later die because of complications allegedly caused by the toxic chemicals that they were exposed to during filming. Stalker is no ordinary film; it belies any formal catergorisaton. You could attempt to describe it as a serious intellectual film about the human condition. It commands your full attention without any distractions. What is Stalker about? Here is an excerpt from an essay generated by ChatGPT: “At its core, Stalker is a meditation on the human quest for meaning, and it grapples with some of the most fundamental questions of the human condition. The protagonist, the Stalker, is a guide who takes people into the mysterious and dangerous Zone, a place where wishes are rumoured to come true. This journey into the unknown serves as a powerful metaphor for the search for meaning and fulfillment, and it forces us to confront the essential ambiguity of existence.” Yes, the quest for meaning, yes, the human condition, yes, the mystery of life. I don’t want to be too critical here, but these are hallmarks evident in most films of this ilk i.e. films by masters particularly from this era. Don’t get me wrong, the questions that are posed by the film are its everlasting impression. However, I don’t want to focus on these questions. What I noticed while watching Stalker was something that was beyond the story, latent in the background if you will, that was more than just a canvas for the monologues and dialogues. It was a very unique aesthetic of how the story was told. How was Stalker’s storytelling unique? I think in a broad sense you could describe the film as feeling ‘real’ or ‘natural’ or as close to real-life as possible. This realism might have been generated by the atmosphere in general i.e. the atmosphere on set and the atmosphere that we see onscreen, which is part Tarkovsky’s direction, and part the desolate wasteland the actors are in. This atmosphere is palpable, so much so that you cannot believe that you are watching the actors navigate this drug-paraphernalia-ridden wasteland for a 'film'. I think unlike many films, and many directors for that matter, Stalker and Tarkovsky achieved the unachievable in cinema: for everything to come from a person's inner being. Now, not all films provoke actors to channel or encounter their inner being, nor do many ask the actors to consider their kismet during filming, and even more rarely for this to be captured on film (an example I can think of is Martin Sheen's bloodied breakdown in Apocalypse Now). Rarely, but most certainly in great films, you forget you are even watching a film, or forget the premise that you are watching actors ‘act’. And with Stalker, this usual pretense of film-watching isn't there. What you see is the human condition opened like a wound. You feel its latent heat like the radiation coming off raw plutonium. It is all laid to bare. Variations of this 'truth' cinema has become more in-vogue of late and is really the frontrunner in terms of aesthetic direction in many art films/non-commercial films (take Nomadland (2017) for example). These films use the language of a 'documentary’ - unchoreographed, unscripted, nonstaged, found-footage etc. They invite you to view the film as reality-in-motion. The overall effect gives you the impression that these people onscreen are not actors, they aren’t even non-actors, they are simply human beings. One of the most memorable moments in Stalker was this sequence where the three protagonists are taking a rest by a creek after having navigated a decent amount of the Zone and have grown tired. The camera (close-up to the actors faces) focuses on each of them, and each of them looks directly into the camera, without speaking or moving, with an expression which is both mute and alive, as if to say, “here I am”, “are you watching this?”, or even more provocatively “what do you make of all this?” With this in mind, Stalker goes beyond any conventional ways of analysing a film, because this wasn’t a ‘film’ in a canonical fictional sense. I thought of it more a documentary. But 'documentary'? It isn't that either. The footage captured could objectively be described as a journey of three men who meander through a toxic, sulphur-laced wasteland, and would later die because of complications arising from their exposure to this toxic wasteland. I honestly don’t know what to call that. And as much as it is a 'film' by definition, the word ‘film’ doesn’t seem right (Stalker can’t be analysed with the same analytical lens you would cast over a David Lynch film for example). Stalker isn’t a pure fiction, nor is it a documentary, nor is it even a docufiction. Those people, cast and crew, were out there, exploring these toxic marshes, risking their lives in the name of art. I mean, where, when, how do we draw the line between fiction and non-fiction? And w/w/h do we draw the line between merely a 'film' and a _________?’";

const excerpt11 = 
"'Faint fires, illuminating, going nowhere, coming from nowhere.' Watching Robert Smithson’s film Spiral Jetty (1970) you get a sense of the concept of ‘entropy’ - that everything in the universe is slowly breaking down. For long periods, you watch the construction of the land-art that is the “Spiral Jetty”, located at a point along the shore of the Great Salt Lake, Utah. You see heavy machinery moving mounds of rocks and dirt, with loud, destructive crashes which is interspersed with tranquil shots of the Great Salt Lake water lapping against a rock or the shore. As you watch you then begin to consider “time”. It is as though the water that laps against the rocks has seen it all, from the beginning of time, to the dinosaurs, to now. Then you see the destruction of man, carving up the Earth, assembling it, reconfiguring it, moving it, placing it. Why? To make sense of it. To make sense of time. To make sense of our place on the Earth. Perhaps that is why we carve up the Earth and create monuments, and this is perhaps why Robert Smithson made the Spiral Jetty, a monument to “forget the future” and to try and make sense of our existence on the Earth. For Earth on its own is chaos, and there is no logic or reason in chaos, merely confusion and disrepair. We must make things become clear, through some sort of language, which can be interpreted and communicated, and for this reason we must create things which can be interpreted in some shape or form, which will ultimately bring order to the chaos. This is in many respects the role of art. Is Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty a work of art? I remember when I saw an exhibition of Smithson’s work at The University of Queensland, Smithson touched on the idea of the context of art, and the role of the art gallery. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but he said that the context which art is presented is important, and by Smithson’s definition it would be safe to say that the Spiral Jetty is definitely a work of art, for it communicates something to people on a deep level. It is trying to say something. About time, about the Earth, about entropy. The spiral has no beginning and no end. It forges onwards, spinning, turning, rotating, for infinity, until the end of time. “Rocks, mud, crystals, water” Smithson repeats for every point on the compass. It is the same thing over and over. The same description, the same materials, the same observation - it’s like he’s asking us to consider the makeup of our environment, the infinitude of things which are in our field of view, from the tinniest spec, to the largest mountain, how everything is part and whole and there is no clear definition to tell this from that, this rock, which belongs to this shore, which touches this ocean. It all bleeds into one another. And this Earth that we harvest, move, destroy, carve up, is the same Earth that the dinosaurs walked on. The very same Earth. And yet we forget this fact. The Earth’s surface layer is impermanent. Over thousands of years the top layer will then become subterranean and a new layer will form on top. Spiral Jetty’s longevity is subject to erosion, and who’s lifespan will perhaps be measured in hundreds of years. But what about the film? There is a permanence to film because it preserves things. That is it’s beauty. A film is a record, an artefact, and in this case, Spiral Jetty [Film] (1970) is an artefact of an artefact. The film itself is a work of art documenting a work of art. I don’t know what Smithson’s intention with this film was, whether it was more artefact or more artwork, but I sense it was more artefact. It serves as a document that accompanies the mythology of the Spiral Jetty and shows its transformation from raw Earth into the famous spiral. Gary Shapiro, on the Hold/Smithson Foundation makes an interesting observation: “Smithson's insistence on the significance of entropy and his early accidental death (1973) left open a number of questions concerning the work's maintenance and preservation. They can be condensed to this: to what extent should a work that is meant to exhibit the entropic character of both nature and culture be conserved in its original state?” It is a fascinating question, because on the one hand you would like to preserve the work for it’s cultural and artistic importance. In many ways it is a masterwork and the seminal work of Smithson’s ideas on entropy. Yet the preservation and upkeep of the work would go against the very thing with which it is trying to represent. Personally, I think it should be left to entropic ruin, as I’m sure Smithson would want it to. He had intentions to build up the Jetty even more so it could sit above sea level, but this never materialised. So perhaps this is where the film comes in. Even after the Jetty has disintegrated and eroded, there will still be, captured on film, the light of the day the Spiral Jetty came to be. I like the idea of ‘film’ being a document more so than simply a medium. It’s utility to document is unlike any other medium, bar photography which too documents things. Shapiro notes that Smithson admired Chris Marker’s film “La Jetee”, which in many respects might have actually inspired the Spiral Jetty. La Jetee is a series of still photographs, documenting a man’s travel to the past and the future. This method of storytelling speaks to film’s utility as a medium of documentation. A photograph, like a film, is forever, and is not subject to entropic decay. Why would Smithson choose to make a film about the Spiral Jetty? Why not just take photographs and write an accompanying essay? I think it’s because although a film can serve the purpose to document, it also by nature tells a story. In the Jetty’s case, it shows the raw, untouched Earth turned over into mounds of rocks and mud, and then finally carefully placed to form the spiral. At the end of the film, Smithson is seen traversing the spiral. It’s as though he is searching for something. He runs with a sense of expectation as though expecting some magical discovery. And finally, when he reaches the end of the spiral, he is instead met with a precipice: eternity. And there, at the end of the Spiral Jetty, Smithson, and us the viewer, stare into the abyss of eternity, watching the work of entropic decay that continues outward forever, for all time.";

"Wong kar-wai this, Wong kar-wai that. I’ve heard so much about the films by this famous director, yet have never seen any. Tonight, I am going to see his film Fallen Angels which is set in Hong Kong and Hong Kong was where I was born. Hong Kong holds a dear place in my heart even if I don’t remember much of it. I was only 3 when we left to go live in America. I don't have fully formed memories or any memories that I can recall. My memories seem to be pieced together through photographs my dad took when we lived there, and that’s where my memories end. Perhaps there are latent memories, enmeshed in my subconscious somewhere and perhaps this is where Wong kar-wai's film Fallen Angels comes in, to trigger these latent memories. Will the buildings trigger something in me? The atmosphere? The characters? Aside: I’ve been trying to draw some art and have had little success. The entire time I was thinking ‘this is going to be a work of art I can give to my friend Trent’ and I put this pressure on myself to produce something that Trent would 'like'. It was as though the final outcome had to achieve a certain standard or look a certain way for it to be any good. And going into each drawing with the premise that 'this piece must be a great work of art', was so inhibiting. There was no state of flow, no release, no catharsis. Not that that always happens, but I’ve found that when we let go and are just ‘in it’, we seem to produce great work. There was nothing like that when I was drawing, and I think it had something to do with the pressure and importance I placed on the work which was lurking in the background. Ultimately it was inhibiting my ability to ‘play’. I’m writing this because just now I watched this short 30 second clip on Rick Rubin’s Instagram where he said something like ‘the best ideas come most often and most easily when we are in this relaxed state. If we put pressure on a piece of art too early we instinctually become more cautious and restrain ourselves.’ I think that is exactly what was happening me earlier today. To return to Fallen Angels (and my expectations as I’ve written above), I am putting a lot of pressure on the film to deliver. I have in mind that it will be this masterful work of art that will change my life. Being open to art requires you to be vulnerable and it is by no means easy to allow art to affect you. But I don’t think that is what I’m getting at. What I’m trying to say is that, although I am open to letting Fallen Angels affect me and am going in openly with that conviction, I have this vision of what the film will turn out to be. This vision has been pieced together by positive feedback from friends and people I’ve met, from clips of the film I’ve seen online, it's mysticism as a ‘classic’ of Hong Kong cinema. With all of this circling in my mind before I even step foot into the movie theatre, there is a lot of pressure on the film to deliver. Not just deliver, but to change my life. That is a great expectation and one which only resigns the film to failure. With this expectation, you no longer possess openness towards the work of art, but rather become closed-off. You are no longer pliable, but rather rigid and hard. There is no vulnerability, you are determined to see the film in a particular light. You have made up your mind and nothing will stand in the way. This does not bode well for allowing the film to affect you let alone allow you to enjoy it. Perhaps it is when you least expect art is when it affects you the most. Anyway, about to head out to see Fallen Angels. I’ll be back to write what I thought about it and if the above has anything to do with it. I’ve come back from the film and there’s a few things I’d like to say. First off, I’m bitterly disappointed. Perhaps this is no surprise after what I have written above. As I said, with great expectations it was doomed to fail. But does my disappointment have everything to do with this expectation, or were there other things at play? Stylistically, Fallen Angels is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. The close-up shots, the weird dutch angels, the fisheye lens, it was surreal at times. However, what bugged me was that the film itself seemed to be self-aware of it’s avant-garde approach that it almost became pretentious. That is a criticism that no artist would like to hear, but it is the truth. There was little to no story, and the unreality of the characters created this disconnect which eventually grew into impatience and ultimately a kind of nausea (maybe that was just the dizzying camera movements that never seemed to be more than 2 feet away from someone’s face.) This unreality or suspension of belief was broken many times by the forceful acting of the actors that it neither sat in the fiction camp, nor the docufiction camp, it somehow managed to occupy this uncanny valley of what I can only describe as people-trying-to-act-ordinary-but-not-too-ordinary with lives that are ordinary-but-not-too-ordinary in ordinary Hong Kong (but not the super ordinary, the ‘cool’ ordinary). Basically, the film never settled on whether it wanted to tell the truth about life in Hong Kong or give us the romanticised version. It honestly seemed to occupy this middle-ground that on most occasions I find appealing, yet in Fallen Angels it only became more off-putting. The camerawork of the film was what kept me intrigued and I genuinely looked forward to what interesting composition would arise next. The aesthetics of the film are perhaps why it is so revered and so loved by many. Fallen Angels is a true aesthetic experience and unfortunately, I’m so over aesthetic experiences. I don’t know if this has anything to do with the fact that since watching the Sadie brother’s film Heaven Knows What, I have become more aware of my taste for realism, but I have always disliked films that looked pretty but never had substance. Past examples of films like this are The Tree of Life by Terrence Malik, Only God Forgives by Nicolas Winding Refn, On the Silver Globe by Andrzej Zulawski, Hard to Be A God by Aleksei Yuryevich German, and The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky (which I only watched 30 minutes). All of these films were stylistically some of the greatest works in the history of cinema. So, what was lacking? Concreteness, substance, story. As much as cinema can be art (and in many ways remains a medium for art) there needs to be, for me at least, something deeper than aesthetics. Aesthetics will only go so far. A work of art that looks amateur yet carries weight is far more appealing to me than a work of art that looks masterful yet feels paper-thin. I expected great things from Fallen Angels, and left half-full. Aesthetically satisfying, soulfully wanting, it never seemed to connect with me, and once a film or a novel or a work of art doesn’t grab you immediately, it is a hard road for it to come round. 3 out of 5. This has gotten me thinking about aesthetics in films and I wonder whether aesthetics are even a concern for some directors? I think many mainstream directors care more about story, and aesthetics are sort of a by-product. I’ve never read Finnegan’s Wake, but was Joyce only concerned about aesthetics in that novel? I’ve flicked through it and it makes absolutely no sense. I know there may be more to it but I just don’t understand it. Maybe I’m missing something? Are aesthetics even separate from storytelling? Is it baked into the story itself? So far I’ve been describing aesthetics, at least in film, as a separate entity, a kind of “film” or “coating” that is sort of vacuum-sealed over the story, as though aesthetics are the film’s facade and the story it’s bricks and mortar. Am I on the right track here? I just read a bit of criticism of Finnegan’s Wake. It seems like nobody really understood it at the time, and many people do not understand it even today. I am all for experimentation, as long as it at least reaches back to reality. David Lynch is a master at this and his films are at times utterly absurd and abstract, yet deep with meaning. Many films I’ve seen that are ‘experimental’ care more for the fact of their experimentation than communicating anything intelligible to the average human. These works I feel are critically ‘unrelatable’. Again, I am all for experimentation and trying things out, but not every idea is a good idea, and to put out every idea into the world and frame it as some kind of ‘experiment’ without any deeper thought, self-criticism or analysis, creates follies not foundations. There must be some aspect of curation or refinement to art, and I find that many people just put up/out whatever new thing they’ve come up with online without any sort of deeper thought other than to seek validation or seek exposure or even as a way of saying “I’m still here”. The democratisation of marketing artwork, particularly through Instagram, has allowed anyone, literally anyone, to put their work out and draw in an audience. But that in turn has flooded the ‘market’ with so much content that there now appears to be a sea of mediocrity. Am I a part of this mediocrity? Am I just putting out my content and framing them as ‘criticism’? Is any of this criticism ‘good’? Hard to say, but I’ll keep writing anyway.";
